          All modern websites and web applications are built using
          <em>three fundamental technologies</em>: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          These are the languages of the web.

          In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
          about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
          <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
          language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
          of a webpage (not a programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
          paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
          understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        <!--
          ol stands for ordered list
          li stands for list item
          Used create list of points
    -->
        <ol>
          <li>The opening tag</li>
          <li>The closing tag</li>
          <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You can learn more at the
          <!--
        target="_blank" opens the link in new tab
    -->
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
            target="_blank"
            >MDN Web Docs</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
        <p>
          There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
          the web. Here are 5 of them:
        </p>
        <!--
        ul stands for unordered list, for showing bullet points.
    -->
        <ul>
          <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
          <li>
            To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
            Worpress or Wix
          </li>
